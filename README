DBIx/Cursor version 0.14
========================

The class DBIx::Cursor represents a cursor for a single Database-table.
You can select, update, insert or delete entries in a table easier than
creating SQL-statements. It does not use any specific features of any
database, so it should work with every DBD-driver.

DBIx::Cursor is not a replacement for DBI, but a add-on. You can use
DBI as usual and use SQL-statements as you need.
